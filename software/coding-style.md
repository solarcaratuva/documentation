# Coding Style

## Naming Conventions

- Class names should use `PascalCase`
- Function and variable names should use `snake_case`

## Software Development Principles

- DRY (Don't repeat yourself)
    - Minimize the amount of repeated code
- Rule of Three 
    - Refactor once code is repeated 3 or more times
- KISS (Keep it simple, stupid)
    - Limit the amount of code in each function (40-50 lines max)
- YAGNI (You Arenâ€™t Gonna Need It)
    - Only implement what you need now
